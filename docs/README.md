# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management knowledge base! Here you'll find standardized documentation on how we initiate, plan, execute, track, manage risks, release, and continuously improve our projects.

## Quick Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme follows a structured lifecycle to deliver projects successfully:

### 1. **Initiation**
Validate business need and align stakeholders. Create a lightweight Project One-pager that captures the problem statement, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial risk assessment. Move to planning only when success criteria are clear and stakeholders agree on priority.

**Key Deliverables:** Project One-pager, Stakeholder list, High-level timeline, Initial risk list

### 2. **Planning**
Break approved initiatives into actionable plans and shippable increments. Define the prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria, estimate scope, identify dependencies, and create a release plan with clear milestones.

**Key Deliverables:** Prioritized backlog, Release timeline, Definition of Done, Dependency map

### 3. **Execution & Tracking**
Manage day-to-day delivery, maintain team rhythm through standups and demos, and ensure quality through testing and CI. Track progress toward milestones, escalate blockers systematically, and maintain transparency through dashboards and metrics.

**Key Activities:** Daily standups, Weekly delivery syncs, Sprint planning, PR reviews, QA and testing

### 4. **Risk Management & Communication**
Identify, assess, and mitigate risks throughout the project lifecycle. Maintain a risk register, communicate regularly with stakeholders using clear templates, and follow escalation paths for blockers and incidents.

**Key Artifacts:** Risk register, Weekly status updates, Escalation paths, Communication cadence

### 5. **Release & Deployment**
Standardize how OctoAcme releases features to production with clear pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, and rollback plans. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met, CI/security scans pass, and smoke tests are prepared before deployment.

**Key Activities:** Pre-release validation, Deployment to staging/production, Post-deploy verification, Release notes

### 6. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**
Capture learnings after each sprint, release, or milestone. Identify what went well and what could improve, convert insights into actionable items, and track improvements over time to foster a culture of continuous learning.

**Key Activities:** Retrospective meetings, Action item tracking, Impact measurement, Team feedback

### 7. **Roles & Personas**
Clear role definitions ensure accountability and effective collaboration across the team. Project Managers coordinate delivery, Product Managers define outcomes, Developers implement solutions, QA validates quality, and Stakeholders provide input and approvals.

**Core Roles:** Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA/Testing, Stakeholders

## Key Principles

OctoAcme projects are guided by these core principles:

- **Customer-first:** Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery:** Deliver small, testable increments to gather feedback early
- **Clear ownership:** Each project has named Project Manager and Product Lead roles
- **Data-informed decisions:** Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety:** Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement
